This app can classify the photos into their respective class, basically you can
select the photo and app will use deep learning to tell you which object or thing is
present in that photo, example: if i select the photo of a Golden retriever Dog, app
will tell me its breed (Golden retriever) or if you select a photo of a mushroom it
can tell you which one it is. This app can classify 1000 different classes and uses a
pre-trained mobile_net_v1 model for this purpose.
